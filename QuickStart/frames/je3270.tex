\chapter{Using 3270 Emulator inside eclipse}

Powerful \mxproduct~extension is designed for mainframe COBOL development enhancement. First of all, 3270 access to mainframe remains the basic way of working with a mainframe (but not the most comfortable, as already shown in this document)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to \textbf{``Window \RHD~Preferences \RHD~\mxproduct~\RHD~je3270''} and adjust the values for your environment (at least, Host name field must be filled with IP address or DNS name of your host)

You will be able to define a customized key map.

\item Launch the 3270 emulator from menu \textbf{``\mxproduct~\RHD~je3270 Terminal session''}:

\item Your favorite welcome screen is displayed! Enter your credentials.

You are now at home in your usual mainframe environment BUT inside eclipse!

A button bar appears above the je3270 window with useful functions. Additional shortcuts are defined in keymap file (see Help Contents / 3270 Terminal for further information)

\textit{Note: F10 key is well interpreted by je3270 but in the same time trapped by eclipse, activating File Menu. You have to retype F10 to give focus back to je3270. A bottle of good champagne for a fix of this issue!}
\end{enumerate}
